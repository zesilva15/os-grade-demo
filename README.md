## Operating Systems Project
## _Racing Simulator_



Project developed in the scope of the Operating Systems discipline.
The system to be developed should simulate, in a simplified way, a car race,	
similar to Formula 1 races.	Several teams will compete for the first place in the	
race.	
- Each team can have one or more cars in the race, but each team will only have one	
a place in the pit.	
 - The winning car is the first car that manages to finish the number of	
laps of the race.	Racing cars need to go into the pits to fill up with fuel or when	
fuel or when they have a breakdown.	
- Racing car breakdowns are random, and if a car breaks down, it goes into safety mode (reduced speed, and priority in the pit) and must go to the team's pit for repair.	
- The cars	
will have to manage their fuel level in order to refuel in the pit as soon as possible.	
as soon as possible.	
- If the fuel level reaches a minimum level, the car will go into
mode.
